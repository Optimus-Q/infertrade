\ruledescription{A detrended price oscillator is an oscillator that strips out price trends in an effort to estimate the length of price cycles from peak to peak or trough to trough.
Unlike other oscillators, such as the stochastic or moving average convergence divergence (MACD), the DPO is not a momentum indicator. It instead highlights peaks and troughs in price, which are used to estimate buy and sell points in line with the historical cycle.
}

\howtotrade
{The strategy is to identify asset's price cycles.
Bullish Reversal - when DPO is above zero \&
Bearish Reversal - when DPO is below zero.

\section{Equation}
Below are the equations which govern how this specific trading rule calculates a trading position.

\begin{equation}
DPO = P_{\frac{\lookbacklength}{2} + 1} - SMA(\lookbacklength)
\end{equation}
\\
where: \\
$P_{\frac{\lookbacklength}{2} + 1}$ : Closing Price of asset where look back periods are determined using $\frac{\lookbacklength}{2} + 1$.
\\ \\
e.g. if $\lookbacklength = 20$ then closing price of asset would be from $\frac{20}{2} +1 = 11$ periods ago.
\\ \\
$SMA(\lookbacklength)$ : is the Simple Moving Average with number of periods determined using parameter \lookbacklength.
