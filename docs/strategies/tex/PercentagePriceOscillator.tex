\ruledescription{The percentage price oscillator (PPO) is a technical momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages in percentage terms. The moving averages are a 26-period and 12-period exponential moving average (EMA).
The PPO is used to compare asset performance and volatility, spot divergence that could lead to price reversals, generate trade signals, and help confirm trend direction.
}

\howtotrade
{The strategy is to identify asset's price cycles.
Bullish Reversal - when PPO is above zero \&
Bearish Reversal - when PPO is below zero.

\section{Equation}
Below are the equations which govern how this specific trading rule calculates a trading position.

\begin{equation}
    PPO = \frac{EMA(\lookbacklength_{s}) -         EMA(\lookbacklength_{l})}{EMA(\lookbacklength_{l})} \times 100
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    Signal = EMA(S_{l})
\end{equation}
\\ % creates some space after equation
where:

$EMA(\lookbacklength_{s})$: is the short term exponentially weighted average.

$EMA(\lookbacklength_{l})$: is the long term exponentially weighted average.

$EMA(S_{l})$: is the exponentially weighted average computed to generate signal line.
