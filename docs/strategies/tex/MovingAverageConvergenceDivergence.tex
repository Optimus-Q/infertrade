\ruledescription{Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that
shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price.
The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.
}

\howtotrade
{The strategy is to identify bullish and bearish crossovers.
Bullish crossover - when MACD line cross above the signal line
Bearish Crossover - when signal line cross above the MACD line.

\section{Equation}
Below are the equations which govern how this specific trading rule calculates a trading position.

\begin{equation}
MACD = EMA(\lookbacklength_{s}) - EMA(\lookbacklength_{l})
\end{equation}
\\
\begin{equation}
Signal = EMA(S_{l})
\end{equation}
\\ % creates some space after equation
with:

$EMA(\lookbacklength_{s})$: is the short term exponentially weighted average.

$EMA(\lookbacklength_{l})$: is the long term exponentially weighted average.

$EMA(S_{l})$: is the exponentially weighted average computed to generate signal line.
